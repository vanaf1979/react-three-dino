# React Three Fiber & Vite starter

This here is my personal ultra simple React Three Fiber starter using Vite for bundling.

it includes:
- [Three](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)
- [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)
- [Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei)
- [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)

Simply fork, clone, npm install and make it your own.
